    VALUES (NULL,0,'How To Choose The Robot Vacuum Cleaner?','','how-to-choose-the-robot-vacuum-cleaner','',@secid,'left','<div><p>As predicted by science-fiction writers, robots are thoroughly part of our everyday life. In the 21st century, man was able to charge almost all labor intensive household chores robot. In this article, I explain robotic vacuum cleaners, as well as the main criteria when choosing a particular model. This powerful helpers in agriculture, essential cleaners in Your home.</p>\n<p>When you select electronic assistant, you must take into account the technical characteristics of the device, as well as a huge number of other important factors.</p>\n<p>it is Worth noting that you cannot compare the robot vacuum cleaners with their established counterparts, who are firmly ужились near us. Smart and independent robots have lower suction power than conventional vacuum cleaners, and in a fraction of the volume of the box. These shortcomings, with interest, is compensated by the presence турбощетки, autonomy, and an enviable regularity cleaning the room, which, as is known - the guarantee of purity, as a consequence and health. Finally-and low power consumption.</p>\n<p>Robot vacuum cleaner is an electronic assistant, relieving you from burdensome domestic chores - cleaning, and also considerably saves your time and effort.</p>\n<p>the Following are the settings in which you can make your choice of a suitable you a robot.</p>\n<p><strong>what you need to know?</strong></p>\n<p>the Size of the premises.</p>\n<p>This Central principle of cleaning the whole room, using one battery robotic vacuum, however, there is of course a model with automatic charging. If you have a larger home or one\'s own house wisely choose a vacuum cleaner with a more capacious battery, or with auto-recharge. Technical characteristics robots this option is certainly indicated, however, remember that the maximum working time (which is noticeably reduced, for example, if the robot carries out cleaning of the carpet, and therefore, you need to choose a vacuum cleaner with a float operation.</p>\n<p>the Layout.</p>\n<p>If You are a happy owner of a Studio apartment or a maximum kopeck piece, you can not hesitate to choose any of the robot. But, if the layout of the apartment is unusual or difficult, that, of course, you need to pay attention to the models of robots with the system of orientation in space. Today there are several such systems, based on the use of a camera or special sensors to build a map of the route cleaning, also use the system of «Virtual wall». This special beacons-terminators, which are not always in the kit. Use of the system beacons looks convincing, however, carries some additional costs to the robot will just not go on the premises need to set the beacon. The cost of lighthouses are relatively high, for instance, in our shop the average price varies from 800 roubles to 2000 roubles, depending on the model of the robot vacuum cleaner. Today beacons - the most acceptable solution for cleaning large areas.</p>\n<p>after-Sales service, repair and availability on the market of consumables and spare parts.</p>\n<p>the Domestic market «software» doesn\'t have the proper development, which accordingly affects the quality of services provided. In General, the majority of the companies directly apply to the customers. That\'s why this point is one of the fundamental when choosing a robotic assistant. By the way, we have in store is the entire range of maintenance services, is: a full repair, diagnosing problems, as well as specialist advice when selecting a robot or accessories.</p>\n<p>the Type of flooring.</p>\n<p>The coverage in your house is better - the easier the robot, it will be removed. Robots don\'t like to uneven floors, and prefer wooden, tile and linoleum. For carpets there are norms according to the height of the pile and its density. Currently, the maximum height of the pile for robots is about 20 millimeters - carpeted floor with a high pile robot or not be able to accurately process (won\'t be enough brushes), or will it go from bad terrain. You should not rely on these devices in cleaning carpets with long pile, and all the more change, for this task, a normal vacuum cleaner robot. Hence we can conclude that for coatings with high pile best suited robots with a long bristles on the brush and sufficient traffic, is the large wheels and quite powerful engine; cleaning smooth coating, you can select any model of the robot.</p>\n<p>air filtration System.</p>\n<p>If you have allergies or you have little children or a lot of heavy (construction) dust, then you necessarily should pay attention filtering systems. During the cleaning of some models of robot vacuum cleaners carry out air filtration, namely being chased away the dust settled on the floor through the built-in filters, blowing it back into the room, respectively already filtered.</p>\n<p>Quite good results provide filters HEPA - <strong>H</strong><em>igh </em><strong>E</strong><em>fficiency </em><strong>P</strong><em>articulate </em><strong>A</strong><em>bsorption</em>, which means roughly «high efficiency while absorbing particles». Such filters are used in robot vacuum cleaners companies iRobotYujin RobotSamsung Special nano-filters йонами silver have ECOVACS.</p>\n<p>Pets.</p>\n<p>subject to the availability of house dogs, cats, parrots and other friends of our smaller should make a choice in favor of the device with a good mechanism of cleaning brushes in order to simplify the removal of намотавшейся in the process of harvesting, wool, feathers and others, and also more spacious container мусоросборника. Manufacturer iRobot, there is even a special robot designed for cleaning in premises with animals, iRobot Roomba 564 Pet</p>\n<p>along with the above criteria, there are many other options also necessary to pay attention to. For example, it can be:</p>\n<p>Voice guidance.</p>\n<p>Some models of robot vacuum cleaners, during cleaning, every action may be accompanied by audio commentary, and some of them sing songs, for example, this functionality is implemented in the model DeeBot D73 However, do not give preference to the robot singing songs and telling about his every step, because the main function of the robot cleaner - cleaning. By the way, the model DeeBot D73 not bad and besides, described above is supplemented by other important functions.</p>\n<p>Wet cleaning.</p>\n<p>is that in the lower part of the body of the robot is attached special cloth moistened with water, which when cleaning and wiping the floor. Such a construction is not effective because napkin dries quickly. On the carpets cleaning efficiency in General is close to zero, and divide cleaning of carpet and other coatings on several stages there is no special meaning. So, even after the purchase of such a robot floors still have to wash yourself;)</p>\n<p>the Functions of cleaning the charging dock.</p>\n<p>it\'s interesting and attractive option. The fact is that the robot gets the opportunity to purge itself, i.e. to get rid of the cleaned of debris and dust through cleaning dust bag. Cleaning bag happens automatically - the robot arrives at a base where the vacuum cleaner base blows dust from vacuum cleaner robot in its own container. However, brush robotic vacuum anyway will be clear to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>of Course, to buy a robotic vacuum must be taken very seriously. Currently, this format is not particularly common in the population and ask (show live) - neighbor don\'t succeed. The Internet is full of videos with robotic vacuum cleaners, however, their major part is promotional in nature, and serious, comparative review very little. Our managers with pleasure will consult you and help you choose the most optimal functionality assistant.</p> </div>\n',1,0,

The extent to which the robots are allowed to influence the lives of people? How to avoid accidents? Is it possible to prevent the intentional infliction of harm? What happens if the robot is capable of sexual manifestations? \"The question is what kind of government we delegate machines, \" said Robert Arkin, Professor of robotics at the Georgia Institute of Technology. - Are we going to, for instance, give robots the ability to use lethal force or any force with the kind of crowd control?\" The future code is a sign that the reality caught up with science fiction. Ethical issues predicted in the 1950s science fiction writer Isaac Asimov, whose book \"I - robot\" recently filmed in Hollywood. Movies \"Terminator\" and \"Robocop\" also showed crazed mechanical guards. <br/><br/>Current robots do more mundane tasks: the most common in Britain robots are Autonomous vacuum cleaners like Scooba, lawn like Robomow and toys like Robosapien. <br/><br/><br/>But there are machines <strong>who</strong> is much more complicated. The national health service uses a robot named Da Vinci surgery in a London hospital of Guy\'s and St Thomas` NHS Foundation Trust. In Japan, robots like Asimo Honda and Sony Qrio can walk on two legs. It is expected that a more advanced version <strong>who</strong> will <strong>only</strong> in 20 years, will do their daily chores and care for the elderly. <br/><br/>\"I hope they <strong>always</strong> will subordinates, \" said science-fiction writer Brian Олдисс. - But there is no doubt that we will largely depend on them\". The story Олдисса \"Суперигрушки live <strong>all</strong> summer\" (Supertoys Last All Summer Long) was laid in the Foundation of the film, Steven Spielberg\'s \"e\", devoted to the question of whether to deny equal rights androids, <strong>who</strong> were as smart as people. <br/><br/>Other dilemmas may arise sooner than we think, says Christensen. \"People are going to have sex with robots not <strong>more</strong> than five years,\" he said. Whether to set the framework, for example, the appearance of such a toy? But the biggest danger seems to mean robots, able to study in their \"experience\". With the development of systems of robots may appear more advanced built-in mechanisms of self-learning, and accurately predict their behavior will become impossible. <br/><br/>\"I think that machine intelligence will appear until 2020\", said Ian Pearson, futurologist of BT (scientific laboratory of British Telecom. - Approx. amended). - If we invest consciousness in the robot, it will be an Android. This is a huge ethical change\". <br/><br/>Critics, who say that up of intelligent robots is still far, robotics respond that the machine is already having a huge impact on our lives, for example, on the Internet. <br/><br/>New ethical recommendations for robots <br/><br/>- Personal security: to ensure the control of man over the robot. <br/><br/>- Public safety: prevent illegal use. <br/><br/>- Personal information: protect data <strong>who</strong> keeps a robot. <br/><br/>- the Possibility of tracking: register actions of the robot. <br/><br/>- Identification: to provide every robot ID. <br/><br/>the Laws of the robot by Isaac Asimov <br/><br/>Robot may not injure a man or by inaction facilitate harm to the person. <br/><br/>- Robot must obey the orders of the person unless they are in conflict with the first law. <br/><br/>- Robot must protect themselves, if this is not in contradiction with other законаминам intellect and I would prefer to give priority to the people\"</p> </div>\n',1,0,

But life is accelerated and already wish technique everything by yourself. <strong><em><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://homerobot.com.ua/\">Robot vacuum cleaner</a></em></strong> great to do all the dirty work for You and yourself will turn and do a clean house. It is known that people with a vacuum cleaner is actually removes only 60 % of dust, and this smart auto home assistant - easy to cover up to 95 % and incredibly fast!<br/><br/>Wireless robot vacuum cleaner himself moved around the house, identifying pollution, suck dust, debris and other dirt. It can be used at home and in the office. This achievement robotics clears any flooring: wooden parquet, plastic flooring, laminate flooring, ceramic tile, carpet coatings and other Optical sensors «inspect» the room and send commands to the devices, which control the movement of the vacuum cleaner. The drive from a battery, which lasts for an hour continuous operation. When you need to recharge the vacuum cleaner itself is approaching a stationary charger.<br/><br/>These robots are produced by companies Electrolux, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://homerobot.com.ua/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage_1.tpl&product_id=2&category_id=7&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=1\">iRobot</a>, Karcher, Applica, Samsung, LG and others are Developing and will soon present a serial samples of companies such as Dyson, Hitachi, Panasonic. <br/><br/>looks Like robot vacuum cleaner? <br/><br/>Externally, the robot vacuum cleaner is similar to the round surround disc with a diameter of 28-35 cm, and its small dimensions (height 9-13 cm) allows him freely to clean even under wardrobes, beds and other furniture. Weight (2-3 kg), and the dimensions of the vacuum cleaner will pleasantly surprise, however, these modest dimensions impose significant restrictions on the volume of container for dust. <br/><br/>On the surface of the robot are located: a battery indicator buttons for setting the size of the room and a pen for migration. On the sides of the connector for charger, on/off button vacuum cleaner, removable bin and protective bumper with a sensor room boundaries. The robot moves on two wheels, each of which has its own engine. <br/><br/>On the bottom of the vacuum cleaner are also mechanisms cleaning (between the wheels): <br/>- side rotary brush (collects dust along the walls and in remote places and sends it to the suction aperture cleaner);<br/>- two rotating towards each other brushes (collect garbage medium and large size); vacuum mechanism (for the very small Sora). <br/><br/>the Work of robot control a variety of built-in sensors sensor dust determines the degree of contamination and in accordance with this selects the mode of cleaning the touch sensors allow bypass obstacles and optical sensors detect voids on the bottom surface exclude the danger of falling down the stairs. In addition, some models are equipped with ultraviolet lamp, which helps the robot to «see» mould, mites and other nasty things that it\'s hard to see with the naked eye. <br/><br/>Informative LCD display will show how much time is left until the end of the harvest and before the expiration of the battery charging. Pleasant and useful adjunct to a vacuum cleaner will be a remote control. And Samsung models can be activated using the mobile phone.<br/><br/>Navigate in space robot vacuum cleaner can use ultrasound (of the trilobite of from Electrolux): covered with fine Golden plate acoustic locator picks up the vibration at a frequency of 60 kHz, and its semicircular shape gives the robot a viewing angle of 180?. Thus he correctly identifies the wall, the legs of the chairs, doorways and stairs easily overcomes the wires, cables and border floor-carpet».<br/><br/>New and absolutely necessary feature robotic vacuum - timer to set the day and even the exact time of harvesting. At the appointed time the vacuum cleaner itself gets the job done, and turns off. You can program a vacuum cleaner for daily cleaning and after a while you will feel that the air in the apartment was much cleaner. <br/><br/>How removes the robot vacuum cleaner? <br/><br/>cleaning Mode is selected by pressing the button: the cleaning time 20 min depending on room size and degree of contamination. Configuration options robot extensive: select the number of days of cleaning per week and the duration of each cleaning (from 20 minutes to 1 hour). The optimal duration of cleaning to 40 minutes because he needs more and charger-sought-after cleaning. But the type of surface you do not have to - cleaning mechanism will automatically adjust to the properties of the surface being cleaned.<br/><br/>Maximum speed - 40 cm2/S. the Robot goes through the premises in the following modes: spiral, chaotic, along the walls, a zigzag. It can be controlled manually, if thought he misses a plot. Robot tirelessly vacuuming until no signal is given with the database or the surface is perfectly clean. Vacuum cleaner will automatically reconnect if it will be lifted or that it has stopped due to insuperable obstacles. <br/><br/>If you want to limit the space for cleaning, special device is used, the sending an invisible beam and retarding the vacuum cleaner in a required part of the room. Attention! Before use carefully read the instructions: robot vacuum cleaner should not be used for cleaning any liquids, including water; robot vacuum cleaner is not suitable for cleaning of carpets with long pile; it is not recommended to run robot vacuum cleaner in отсыревшее room. <br/><br/>How is charging the robotic vacuum and dust removal? <br/><br/>the Device is powered by two rechargeable NiMH alkaline batteries and do not require a network connection. Time of work of the vacuum cleaner with a fully charged battery depends on the surface of the floor: battery lasts from 60 minutes of work on a carpet with an average length of the pile, and up to 120 minutes on the floors paved. When the batteries robot «sit», it finds charger and goes charge. To charge the battery pack require from 3 to 12 h<br/>Some models come with a charging dock. The iPod vacuum cleaner gets himself when he needed to charge the batteries. «Communication» of the vacuum cleaner with the database by using infrared sensor, therefore, if the charger is not in sight, vacuum cleaner it just isn\'t finding. IPod he «sees» only near, so the search can travel around the entire perimeter of the premises, until it gets. <br/><br/>unfortunately, most robots can\'t upload the collected dust - its owners would delete themselves. Dust container is easily removed and вытряхивается. But the filter (membrane) must be wiped that is not very pleasant. Recommendation: under the membrane you can lay a gauze and after harvest to throw it, thereby freeing yourself from the need to clean the membrane, and the filter will be less снашиваться. <br/><br/>In some models of the basic device is intended not only for recharging, but also for accumulation of the collected dust. When you are docked with the base, vacuum cleaner is not simply recharged, but also resets the dust in large dust collector drive. The collected trash them automatically removed by suction device database (charging station). This charger has a large (compared to other robotic vacuum cleaners) dimensions. However, despite the fairly large size, battery charger quite easy and convenient to carry - small width and comfortable handle allow it to be transported easily. <br/><br/>2 additional benefits: <br/><br/>- Noise. Robot vacuum cleaner is not working silently, but a little quieter standard vacuum cleaners. In addition, the noise level can be adjusted, although a reduction audio level вЗлечет reduce the suction power. <br/><br/>- energy Consumption. In winter, cloudy weather for harvesting standard vacuum cleaner you may need a light to see that vacuuming. Robot vacuum cleaner, of course, not need of light. <br/><br/>it is a miracle of technology from $ 400, advanced German model more than 1500 $. <br/><br/>All current <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://homerobot.com.ua/\">robot vacuum cleaners</a> - this is the first generation. Robots are the next generation will be, for example, in addition to cleaning to keep the house, and incremental «arm» hold «a three-dimensional cleansing».
